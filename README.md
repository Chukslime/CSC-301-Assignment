# Number Classification Program

This program is designed to classify an input number as zero, even, or odd. It utilizes structured programming concepts such as if-else statements to achieve this classification.

## Usage

1. When you run the program, it prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Once the user enters a number, the program checks if the number is zero, even, or odd.
3. Depending on the classification, the program prints a corresponding message to the user.

## Example

```
Enter a number: 7
The number is odd.
```

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number using the `input` function.
2. It reads the input number and checks if it is zero, even, or odd using the if-else statements.
3. If the number is zero, it prints "The number is zero."
4. If the number is even, it prints "The number is even."
5. If the number is odd, it prints "The number is odd."
